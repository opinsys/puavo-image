# Site-specific additions and overrides for usr.sbin.slapd.
# For more details, please see /etc/apparmor.d/local/README.

# With our slapd + krb5 configuration, apparmor produces lot of
# following kind of log messages:
#
# type=1400 audit(1416998949.859:2325): apparmor="DENIED"
# operation="open" parent=25498 profile="/usr/sbin/slapd"
# name="/etc/gss/mech.d/" pid=25503 comm="slapd" requested_mask="r"
# denied_mask="r" fsuid=119 ouid=0
#
# Because we do not have any extra GSSAPI mechanisms, we just tell
# apparmor that the denial is exactly the right thing to do, it keeps
# quiet and does not inform us anymore.

deny /etc/gss/mech.d/ r, # Silence noise.
