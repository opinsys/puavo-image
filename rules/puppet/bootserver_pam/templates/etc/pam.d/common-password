# /etc/pam.d/common-password - password-related modules common to all services
#
# This file comes from opinsys-bootserver package

# here are the per-package modules (the "Primary" block)
password	sufficient	pam_unix.so obscure sha512
# here's the fallback if no module succeeds
password	requisite			pam_deny.so
# prime the stack with a positive return value if there isn't one already;
# this avoids us returning an error just because nothing sets a success code
# since the modules above will each just jump around
password	required			pam_permit.so
# and here are more per-package modules (the "Additional" block)
# end of pam-auth-update config
