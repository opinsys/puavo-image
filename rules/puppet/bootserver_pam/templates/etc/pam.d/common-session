# /etc/pam.d/common-session - session-related modules common to all services
#
# This file comes from opinsys-bootserver package

# prime the stack with a positive return value if there isn't one already;
# this avoids us returning an error just because nothing sets a success code
# since the modules above will each just jump around
session	required			pam_permit.so
# The pam_umask module will set the umask according to the system default in
# /etc/login.defs and user settings, solving the problem of different
# umask settings with different shells, display managers, remote sessions etc.
# See "man pam_umask".

# and here are more per-package modules (the "Additional" block)
