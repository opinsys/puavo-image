# This script is called from OpenVPN when client connection to VPN 
# server is established. The script writes a configuration file 
# /etc/dnsmasq.d/10-puavo-vpn.conf that redirects DNS queries for ldap 
# and kerberos master servers to go to nameserver at the gateway 
# address.
#
# This makes it possible to have multiple VPN gateways where each 
# gateway has its own endpoint address. When the client connects to 
# different VPN server, the settings change and dnsmasq is restarted for 
# the changes to take effect.
